                    Make sure your account is the only account that can access

                </li>
                <li>
                    Change your password, If i had access to the full server
                    panel; It likely means i had access to your account aswell.

            <p>
                If i got your password it means it is insecure. <br />
                as of the moment i am typing this i do <b>NOT</b> have any brute
                forcing tool! <br />So, what does this mean? <br />
                It means i probaly just geussed your password. That isnt a
                secure password, lets fix it together!<br />
                so. First get a password manager, a free one such as bitwarden
                should do. <br />
                now for this password please use a single, But secure
                password.<br />Its important that the only place that password
                is stored.<br />Additionally please use
                <a href="https://www.passwordmonster.com/" target="_blank"
                    >passwordmonster.com</a
                >
                to ensure the password is actually secure.<br />
                The longer it will take to crack, the better.<br />Now, for your
                passwords. use only randomly generated passwords.<br />
                Additionally, dont reuse any of the passwords. You dont want an
                data breach getting all your accounts hacked right? <br />For
                the randomly generated password, i reccomend using all
                characters and with a length of 16 or more. The longer the
                password the more secure it is! <br />
                <b>ParrotsAreCool</b> isnt a secure password btw
