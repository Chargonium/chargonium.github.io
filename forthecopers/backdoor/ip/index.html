            <h1>What is an ip?</h1>
            <p style="text-align: left">
                An ip is what the internet uses to identify specific networks,
                There are 2 types of ip's; A private and a public ip. <br />
                A private ip starts with 192.168; And these are competely
                useless for other networks. As a private ip is only used in your
                network. <br />
                However, a public ip <i>can</i> is what you clicked to get here!
                <br />
                usually, these are just as useless as an private ip. Besides,
                whenever you visit an site, or go into any minecraft server, the
                site or server gets your ip.<br />That is also how i showed you
                your ip!<br />
                And no, im not going to do shit with the ip, its not worth the
                effort.
