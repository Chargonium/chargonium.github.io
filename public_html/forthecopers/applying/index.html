                What to do if im applying for a staff possition on your server.
            </h1>
            <p>
                Well, believe it or not there are servers i actually care about!
                <br />
                However, when im applying on my main account, The reason isnt
                always because i care about your server. <br />
                When im applying using my main its one its for one of two
                reasons!
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>I actually care about the server</li>
                <li>
                    I think you are foolish enough to not do any simple
                    background checks
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                It's up to your interpretation wich one it is.
                <br />However, i vote for you to accept me no matter wich one it
                is :3
